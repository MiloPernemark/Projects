 <p>Kenshin's journey spans a decade of wandering across Japan as a rurouni, driven by a deep desire for redemption. He carries a sakabatō, a reverse-blade sword, with a solemn pledge to never take another life, a stark contrast to his past as an assassin for the Imperialist cause during the Bakumatsu era. In the year 1878, he finally arrives in Tokyo and finds a new home at the Kamiya Dōjō. Here, Kenshin faces countless challenges that put his vow to the test as he dedicates himself to preserving peace in the nation.</p>

 <li> <h3><a href="https://anix.to/anime/horimiya-m0o8/ep-1">Horimiya</a> (ホリミヤ)</h3>
  <p>At first glance, Kyouko Hori and Izumi Miyamura seem like an unlikely pair. Hori is the epitome of beauty and intelligence, while Miyamura comes across as quiet and distant. However, a chance encounter reveals their hidden sides. Hori, despite her popularity, is swamped with housework, leaving little time for friends. In contrast, Miyamura conceals his true self, marked by secret tattoos and piercings, giving off the appearance of a gentle delinquent, unbeknownst to his classmates.</p>
